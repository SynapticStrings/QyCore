# QyCore

Standing on the shoulder of [Orchid](https://github.com/SynapticStrings/Orchid).

QyCore integrates OTP to achieve resource management, fault tolerance, data persistence, and recovery.

* Orchid = DAG + Light Concepts(Scheduler/Executor/Runner/Hooks)
* QyCore = OTP runtime(Instrument registry + Large param injection + optional persistence/hydrate/dehydrate) + Orchid

Currently, over 70% code generated from Calude 4 Opus.

I can ensure the examples are the final apprearance of [QyEditor](https://github.com/SynapticStrings/QyEditor), but the code with HLGHLY infomation density makes me a bit overwhelmed.

So this repo/branch/codebase were temporary archived until I know can figure out clearly and re-implement it by myself.
